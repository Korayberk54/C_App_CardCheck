# C_App_CardCheck

This is a simple valid card checker using Luhn Algorithm. Once you enter a card number, it will tell you if it is a valid number or not.

If it is a valid number, it will also tell you if it is Visa, AMEX, Master etc.

*Remember this project was made for cs50's Problem Set. So to run this, you are going to need to download cs50.h library to your system,
or feel free to mess with the code in a way it does not need that library, since this is a pretty basic algorithm.*
